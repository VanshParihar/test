        <h2>Introduction to IP Addressing</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our educational session on networking fundamentals. Today, we will delve into the first key
            concept: IP addressing. So, let's get started!
        </p>
        <h2>Explanation of IP Addressing</h2>
        <p>
            IP addressing is a fundamental concept in networking. Every device connected to a network is assigned a
            unique numerical identifier called an IP address. These addresses allow devices to communicate with each
            other by enabling data packets to be routed across networks. The most commonly used IP addresses are IPv4,
            which consists of four sets of numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.0.1.
        </p>
        <h2>Transition to IPv6</h2>
        <p>
            However, with the rapid growth of the internet, the availability of IPv4 addresses has become limited. To
            address this issue, IPv6 was introduced. IPv6 uses a longer address format, such as
            2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, providing a virtually unlimited pool of addresses.
        </p>
        <h2>Subnetting and CIDR</h2>
        <p>
            Subnetting allows dividing a network into smaller subnets, enabling efficient allocation of IP addresses. It
            helps in better organization and management of networks. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a
            technique that allows flexible allocation of IP addresses by specifying the number of significant bits in
            the network address.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance and Applications of IP Addressing</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding IP addressing is crucial as it forms the backbone of the internet and enables seamless
            connectivity. It allows devices to send and receive data, browse the web, exchange emails, and much more.
            Without IP addressing, the modern digital world as we know it would not exist.
        </p>
        <h2>IP Address Classes</h2>
        <p>
            There are two major types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers expressed in
            dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.0.1). However, with the growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses have
            become limited. IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128-bit numbers expressed in hexadecimal format
            (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 provides a significantly larger address space to
            accommodate the increasing number of connected devices.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            IP addressing is a crucial concept in computer networking. It enables devices to communicate with each other
            over networks using unique identifiers. Understanding IP addressing, including types, classes, subnetting,
            and CIDR, is essential for network administrators and professionals in building and maintaining efficient
            networks.
